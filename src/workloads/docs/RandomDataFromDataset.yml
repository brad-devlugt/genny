Description: |
  Demonstrate the ChooseFromDataset generator. The ChooseFromDataset generator takes one single
  argument, a path to a file. It then returns random lines from that file. The file should exist
  and shouldn't be empty. As an example you can use familynames.txt, names.txt and airports_codes.txt.
  If you specify a relative path the pathfile will depend on your current working directory (cwd).
  If running in evergreen, the relative path needs to be: src/genny/src/workloads/datasets/.
